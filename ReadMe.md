# hook.io-datastore

Node.js module that powers the hook.io platform's [Cloud Datastore](https://hook.io/datastore)

## Introduction

This module is the component which [hook.io](http://hook.io) uses to allow users to store and retrieve documents from a simple API. Right now, it's essentially a small wrapper around the `redis` module.

You are encouraged to use this module as-is, or modify it to suite your needs. If you are interested in contributing please let us know!
